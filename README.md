# Diabetic Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview
This project implements a **Diabetic Prediction** model using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. The goal is to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical features and patient data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset**, which contains medical records of **768 individuals** with **8 feature columns**. The dataset includes information such as:
- **Pregnancies**
- **Glucose levels**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Skin Thickness**
- **Insulin Levels**
- **BMI**
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**
- **Age**

You can download the dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: [PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The dataset is also uploaded here.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Model Training & Evaluation
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model.
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy.

## Results
- Model accuracy: ~75-85%
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report will be displayed after execution.
